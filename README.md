## üìù Future Developemnt

Some interesting features which could be added to the application include:

* Creating new labels for the boards;
* Creating checklists for the cards;
* Adding stickers to the cards;
* Unit testing;
* Better input validation;

## üõ† Technologies

During the development of this project, the following techologies were used:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Trello API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest/api-group-actions/)

## üíª Project Configuration

### Make sure to install the required packages/libs before running the script

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You must also update the [config,py](./config.py) file with your API key and token, in order to use the application (get yours [here](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)).

```python
